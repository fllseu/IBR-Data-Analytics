This folder contains ERA code: fun_mera.m
Input: time-series data
Output: A, B, C, D matrices

The main file RLC_example_v1_print.m first creats time-series data (the capacitor voltage upon a step change of the source voltage of an RLC circuit), and then invokes fun_mera to compute A, B, C, D matrices. Finally, eigenvalues of A can be found.
